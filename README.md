Character & Story Generator

**In progress*

Notes:
- character.is_dead function is messing wiht the generation system where if you set 80 years to generate, and the character died
within that time, the program doesn't know what to do. 
    - Set a condition to generate milestones to check is_dead parameter as FALSE
